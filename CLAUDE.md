# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A distributed e-commerce platform with 5 microservices. Go services handle I/O-heavy concurrent workloads; Java/Spring Boot services handle complex business logic with transactions.

## Service Map

| Service | Language | Port | Key Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| user-service | Go (Gin + GORM) | 8001 | Pessimistic lock on login |
| cart-service | Go (Gin + GORM) | 8002 | Redis-first, WATCH/MULTI/EXEC |
| payment-service | Go (Gin) | 8003 | Idempotency key + DB UNIQUE |
| product-service | Java/Spring Boot | 8081 | Optimistic lock (@Version + @Retry) |
| order-service | Java/Spring Boot | 8082 | Pessimistic lock on state transitions |

## Infrastructure Commands

Copy and configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with actual values
```

Start only what the current task needs (prefer minimal):
```bash
# Core infrastructure (needed by almost everything)
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Add Kafka only when working on payment/order Kafka flows
docker compose up -d zookeeper kafka

# Start a specific service
docker compose up -d user-service

# Build images (first time or after code changes)
docker compose build             # all services
docker compose build user-service  # single service
```

Databases are initialized automatically on first Postgres start via `script/init-databases.sql`.

## Go Services (user-service, cart-service, payment-service)

Each Go service is a self-contained module. Run from its directory:

```bash
cd user-service   # or cart-service / payment-service

# Run
go run ./cmd/server/main.go

# Build
go build -o bin/server ./cmd/server/main.go

# Test
go test ./...

# Single package test
go test ./internal/handler/...

# Test with race detector (required for concurrency code)
go test -race ./...
```

Config is loaded from environment variables with fallbacks (see `config/config.go`). No config files — set env vars or use a `.env` file with Docker Compose.

Go service internal layout:
- `cmd/server/main.go` — wires dependencies (DB, Redis, router) and starts server
- `config/config.go` — env-based configuration
- `internal/handler/` — HTTP handlers (Gin)
- `internal/middleware/` — recovery + structured logger middleware
- `pkg/response/` — shared response envelope helpers

## Java Services (product-service, order-service)

Each Java service uses Maven wrapper. Run from its directory:

```bash
cd product-service   # or order-service

# Run
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build (skip tests)
./mvnw package -DskipTests

# Test
./mvnw test

# Single test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=ProductServiceApplicationTests
```

Java version: 21. Spring Boot: 3.5. Uses Flyway for DB migrations, Lombok for boilerplate reduction.

## Architecture

### Communication
- **Synchronous REST**: Cart Service calls Product Service (`PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL`) for price/stock validation.
- **Async Kafka (Choreography Saga)**: `orders.created` → Payment Service processes → emits `payments.completed` or `payments.failed` → Order Service updates status. Inside Docker, services connect to Kafka at `kafka:29092` (internal listener), not `kafka:9092` (host port).

### Databases
Single PostgreSQL instance with 5 logical databases (one per service). Cross-DB references are enforced at the application level, not by FK constraints.

| Database | Owned by |
|---|---|
| ecommerce_users | user-service |
| ecommerce_products | product-service |
| ecommerce_carts | cart-service |
| ecommerce_orders | order-service |
| ecommerce_payments | payment-service |

### Redis Usage
- Sessions, JWT blacklist, rate limiting (user-service)
- Cart primary store — Redis is the source of truth, PostgreSQL is a background sync (cart-service)
- Cache layer (product-service)

### Concurrency Locking — Per Service (see `docs/adr/locking-strategy.md`)

| Service | Strategy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| User | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` | Write-heavy login row; lockout correctness critical |
| Product | `@Version` optimistic + `@Retry` | Low contention normal traffic; high throughput |
| Cart | Redis `WATCH/MULTI/EXEC` | Primary store is Redis; per-user contention is low |
| Order | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` | Catastrophic if two state transitions both succeed |
| Payment | Idempotency key + `UNIQUE` constraint | Handles Kafka at-least-once redelivery |

### JWT
- Algorithm: RS256
- Access token TTL: 15 minutes
- Keys: `./keys/private.pem` (sign) and `./keys/public.pem` (verify) — paths configurable via `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`

### API Response Envelope
All responses use a consistent shape (defined in `api/openapi.yaml`):
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "success": true, "data": [...], "meta": { "page": 0, "size": 20, "totalElements": 150, "totalPages": 8 } }
{ "success": false, "error": { ... } }
```

### Health Probes
- Go services: `GET /health/live` + `GET /health/ready` (checks Postgres + Redis)
- Java services: `GET /health/live` only (no `/ready` endpoint yet)

## Key Files
- `docker-compose.yml` — full stack (infrastructure + all 5 service containers); each service has a `Dockerfile` in its root directory
- `script/init-databases.sql` — creates all 5 databases and schemas with indexes
- `api/openapi.yaml` — full REST API contract
- `docs/adr/locking-strategy.md` — detailed rationale for per-service concurrency decisions
- `docs/adr/proposal.md` — full technical proposal with architecture decisions
- `.env.example` — all required environment variables with descriptions
